Today was the live review for Project Check #6. We finalized our group of 7 for the final project although some people are going completely independent. We assigned each other some roles to finish. Finn has decided to work on the Robot, and possibly finishing it, and improving upon. Luka and Edwin have decided to collaborate on developing the Pizza API. They have decided to make one database using JavaScript for the menu. Today Luka fixed the order database, and the next step is showing the table on the frontend. Gene has decided to fix and organize the backend in order to make it easier to work with. Today, Kush was absent, but he was been assigned to make the Tic Tac Toe game, as well as with some help from Edwin. James is also making another 2D Array game, the popular game of Chess. Zeen has been working on the website's Login and Sign Up system as well as some assistance from Gene.

Today, the whole group was present and we continued on the work we had. Today was a day where we had a tech talk, so most of the focus was on that, but afterwards we tried to get some of the group project done. James was able to finish the board for the chess game. Finn also helped James with chessboard, and he also helped Luka with his database. Luka also tried to fix some errors with the CRUD model in the Pizza Menu Table. Edwin and Luka will have to collaborate with Gene on fetching the backend. Edwin also did make some wireframes of the table using the JavaScript although the menu be made using SQLite. Also, Edwin and Kush got the set up ready for tic tac toe, and finalized on a design for it. Zeen and Gene also continued to work on the leaderboard backend and implementing it into each game.

Today in class we did the animation and 2d arrays tech talk. We then also continued working on the plans that we had created and how we were going to incorporate animations into our projects. Finn planned on implementing animation into the robot game by giving the robot movements when it moved into different spaces. Edwin was working on the animations that were presented in class. Afterschool Edwin was working very diligently on tic tac toe and created a working beta.
