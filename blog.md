Today was the live review for Project Check #6. We finalized our group of 7 for the final project although some people are going completely independent. We assigned each other some roles to finish. Finn has decided to work on the Robot, and possibly finishing it, and improving upon. Luka and Edwin have decided to collaborate on developing the Pizza API. They have decided to make one database using JavaScript for the menu. Today Luka fixed the order database, and the next step is showing the table on the frontend. Gene has decided to fix and organize the backend in order to make it easier to work with. Today, Kush was absent, but he was been assigned to make the Tic Tac Toe game, as well as with some help from Edwin. James is also making another 2D Array game, the popular game of Chess. Zeen has been working on the website's Login and Sign Up system as well as some assistance from Gene.
